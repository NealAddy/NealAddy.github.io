1)  John Henry Burnett is shown on LDS IGI records to have been born in Fayetteville, Talladega Co., AL.  I can find no source to confirm that this was indeed the case since it is thought that the Burnett family was still living in Gold Mine, Marion Co., AL at the time of his birth.  
<BR>

<BR>
2)  John Henry and Victoria moved from Gold Mine, Marion Co., AL to DeLeon, Comanche Co., Texas about 1892.  After divorcing Victoria he moved to Erath Co., TX between 1894 and 1896.  He married Angeline Butler in 1897.  After divorcing Angeline he moved back to Comanche Co., TX and married Elizabeth Straley in 1907.

1)   Angeline's first husband was James G. Barnes.  He was born about 1856 in Texas.  They married about July 15, 1876 in Collin Co., TX.
<BR>
Children of James and Angeline are:
<BR>
i.   Ellen Barnes, b. Abt. 1882, Collin Co., TX; d. unknown.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
2)   Angeline's second husband was William Benjamin Whisenant (son of Peter Atus, son of Adam Whisonant).  He was born May 22, 1853 in Habersham, GA, and died June 2, 1894 in Erath Co., TX.  Children of William and Angeline are:
<BR>
i.   Nathan Clarence Whisenant, b. 07/17/1884, Erath Co., TX; d. 01/06/1964, Erath Co., TX
<BR>
ii.  Rendy Whisenant, b. 1886, Erath Co., TX; d. unknown in Elk City, Beckham Co., OK
<BR>
iii. Lockey William Whisenant, b. 06/29/1887, Erath Co., TX; d. 03/21/1976, Burnet, TX
<BR>
iv. Maud Elvira Whisenant, b. 12/29/1891, Erath Co., TX; d. 12/21/1858, Erath Co., TX, buried in New Dublin Cemetery.

<BR>
*Note:  Rendy was Angeline's oldest daughter with W.B. Whisenant.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
4)  Family tradition has it that John Henry and Angeline were only married a short time after the birth of Erbie.  Since John Henry is listed in the 1900 census living with his children by Victoria it is safe to assume that the divorce took place in the same year as Erbies birth (i.e. late 1898 or 1899).  I have yet to locate Angeline on the 1900 or 1910 census records showing her residence/location after divorcing John Henry.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
5)  Angeline is buried in Purves Live Oak Cemetery, Erath Co., TX along side her mother and father.  Several Whisenants, including Angeline's former husband, William, and their son, Nathan, are also buried here.  Headstones are recorded as follows:

6)  Record found in the FAMILY BIBLE of Erby Burnett:
<BR>
Lemuel - born Feb. 12, 1812; died Jan. 6, 1881; married Talitha Cantrell Burnett
<BR>

<BR>
(Note that the date shown above differs slightly from that shown on Lemuel's headstone in Gold Mine Church of Christ Cemetery - i.e. 02/12/1812 vs. 02/02/1812 - see below).
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
7)  Burial Marker Inscriptions  (taken from "Cemetery Inscriptions of Marion Co., AL", ref#  GEN 976.189 S v.1)
<BR>
Gold Mine Church of Christ Cemetery - Located North of Brilliant 1.5 miles on Hwy 129 on East side.
<BR>
Burnett, Lemuel - Feb. 2, 1812 - Jan. 6, 1881
<BR>
*Burnett, E. L. - was born Aug. 30, 1816 and passed this life the 21 day of Jan. 1851 - Age 40 yrs. 3 months 1 day.  Put up by A.A.Smith - 1876
<BR>
Burnett, Mary - Apr. 4, 1817 - June 24, 1896
<BR>
Burnett, Howard E. - Son of John H. Burnett & Victoria Burnett - Jan. __, 1875 - Mar. 29, 1875 - Age 2 mo. & 28 days.
<BR>

<BR>
*Note:  E.L. Burnett must have been John Lemuel's second wife, Tillitha.  Her birth date and date of death are closely similar to LDS IGI records for a Tillitha (Cantrell) Burnett.  The year of death shown in this cemetery record (i.e. 1851) must have been a error on the part of the engraver, recorder, or transcriber.  Also, if she truly was age 40 years, 3 months, and 1 day, then her date of death would have been 12/01/1876 based upon the birth date we have.  This discrepancy cannot be explained.  For the purpose of these records I have elected to show her date of death as 01/21/1857.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
8)  Misc Note:  The Marion Co. Courthouse burned in 1887.  All records prior to that date were destroyed.  
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
9)  Additional Note:  Tillitha and Matilda Cantrell may have been related.  The 1850 census shows a John M. Cantrell living in dwelling next to John Lemuel Burnett.  LDS IGI records show John M. Cantrell to have been married to both Tillitha and Matilda.  Also, based upon these same records, it appears that Tallitha Cantrell may have been John M Cantrell's niece.  John Cantrell's father, Abraham, is shown to be Tallitha's brother.  It should be noted that, so far, the above is nothing more than unconfirmed speculation based upon the few references I have been able to find on this branch of the Cantrell family.  
<BR>

<BR>
The sheer number of branches for its descendents make the Cantrells a difficult family to research.  I have attempted to understand these relationships primarily for the purpose of following John Lemuel's line to a specific area of SC in an attempt to find his father.  Given the (apparently) close relationship of the Burnetts and Cantrells in the AL area it was hoped that following the Cantrells to SC would lead me to the Burnetts.   This path has been difficult due to the ambiguous lineage of the Cantrells, and lack of household information available to me in pre-1850 AL and SC census records.  Numerous queries have been posted to Internet message boards in the hope that a family member in or from the area may be able to help.

Subject:  Marriage Book Lookup - Lemuel Burnett
<BR>

<BR>
Well, I don't know if this will help or complicate things more. The Langdon marriage book lists individuals who's marriage is implied in probate records. The listings on Burnett's have the following that might apply to your family:
<BR>

<BR>
1.  Unknown Burnett was married to Mary (Polly) Ann Cantrell, daughter of George Cantrell; this according to file #1775, filed in 1874, in Spartanburg Co.
<BR>
2.  Lemuel Burnett was married to Mary Clement, daughter of John Clement who died Sept. 18, 1858, according to file #2850, filed in 1858, in Spartanburg Co.  There is also another file (#2156) that implied this marriage in 1867.
<BR>
3.  Lemuel Burnett was married to Mary Cothran (Cothren), widow of Gabriel Cothran, according to file #895, filed in 1857, in Spartanburg Co. (A note here says he/they moved to Alabama.)

Good luck,

Matilda Burnet is listed in the 1860 AL census index  in Burnt Corn Twp, Monroe Co., with a Francis Burnet.  It appears that she moved to Burnt Corn after divorcing John Lemuel between 1851 and 1852.  Neither Matilda nor Francis appear on the 1870 AL census.  The exact identity of Francis Burnet has not been researched at this time.

An LDS IGI record lists Lemuel and Matilda's marriage date as 1854 (in Spartanburg, SC).  This is assumed to be incorrect based upon the 1850 AL Census record for Marion Co., AL (Matilda listed as "wife"), and the date of birth of their children.
