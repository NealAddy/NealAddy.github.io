<BR>
Subj: Page Pond Cemetery Survey 
<BR>
Date: 05/23/2000 
<BR>
From: kay.dillard@juno.com (Marian K Addy) 
<BR>
I noticed discrepancies. 
<BR>
Solomon Peacock and Sarah Jane Elefair (McClellan), (Peacock). (Knight), Kendrick were my great great grandparents. I found their gravesites in the early 90's. 
<BR>
According to my memory and records, Sarah J. Kendrick is buried between husband number 1 on her left, Solomon Peacock, and husband number 3 on her right, E. G. Kendrick. Husband number 2, George Washington Knight is buried in Southport, Florida. 
<BR>
The discrepancies between my records and yours are these: My records show the name "Kindrick" spelled "Kendrick". Also, you have Mr. Kendrick's initials as "E. B". I show them to be "E. G." He was called "Gene". Beside his name you show him as "husband of J. E. Kindrick". He was actually "husband of Sarah J. Kendrick" as I said above. 
<BR>
"I know the work that goes into doing these surveys, because I've left my footprints in many cemeteries and have been on the typing end of it too." 
<BR>
Sincerely, 
<BR>
Kay (Dillard) Addy 
<BR>
P.S. My Grandfather, Solomon Arthur Dillard, maternal grandson of Solomon Peacock is buried in Chipola Cemetery in Altha. My father, George Green Dillard, was the sixth child of Solomon Arthur Dillard and Ransey (Harrell) Dillard. He was born and raised in the Altha vicinity. 
<BR>
J. Troy Peacock (deceased), paternal grandson of Sarah Jane Elefair McClellan, Peacock, Knight, Kendrick who is buried in Page Pond Cemetery said that his Grandmother Elefair married three times, raised three families and gained her second eyesight at age 84. 
<BR>
Sarah Jane Elefair Kendrick is buried between her first and third husbands, Solomon Peacock and E. G. ("Gene") Kendrick. My only information regarding her second husband is that he was a Knight and that he was murdered. Elefair and Mr. Knight had a son, George Washington Knight. He is buried in Southport, Florida. Family members say that Uncle George was an excellent carpenter who built his own casket years before his death. He kept it on the porch in the summer and in the parlor in the winter. My brother, George Dillard, remembers seeing it on the porch.

3)  Several conflicting records exist on Ancestry.com for the person of John Abney.  Likely candidates include listings with several with wife listed as Isabella Van Lear (father: William Abney and Sarah Spraggins), and others with wife listed as Martha Puckett (father: William Abney or Abraham Abney).  Both include a child named Paul.
<BR>

<BR>
*Another record lists Dannett Abney as Nathaniel's father.  See http://pedigree.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/pedview.dll?ti=0&ind=105395&file=125849.  Dannett Abney is found in deed records for Henry Co., VA between 1750-1770.

IMPORTANT!  THIS RECORD IS IS A RESEARCH PLACEHOLDER ONLY.  THE IDENTITY OF JAMES DILLARD AS THE FATHER OF ARTHUR, NANCY, AND JAMES HAS NOT YET BEEN POSITIVELY CONFIRMED.
<BR>

<BR>
Much has been written by various sources regarding the infamous other "James Dillard" and his distinction from the more well documented "Capt. James Dillard".  While little is known about this individual it is certain that he existed and was known by, or possibly related to, the Captain.  
<BR>

<BR>
This research has centered around two premises:  
<BR>
1)  Arthur Dillard, Sr's father was thought to be named James Dillard.  Since this family seems to have moved from VA to SC, and since there were only two "James Dillards" listed in the SC 1790 census, the process of elimination appears to rule out Captain James Dillard as the father of Arthur.
<BR>
2)  Henry Co., VA marriage record for a William Hogan and Nancy Dillard (see #13 below).  Nancy is listed as the "daughter of James".  This family group was shown to have followed the movements of James Dillard from VA to Chester Co., SC (see land deeds below) then to Georgia.  Arthur Dillard was named executor of William Hogan's estate (see will in "notes" section under William Hogan).  Also, a James Dillard (age 78, b. VA) is listed in the household of William Hogan, Jr. in the Campbell Co., GA census for 1850 (see note section under William Hogan, Jr.).  This James was probably James Dillard, Jr., a brother of Nancy (Dillard) Hogan and Arthur Dillard, Sr, both deceased at that time.
<BR>

<BR>
See the DILLARD ANNUAL website (http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~dillard/dannuals/datitlep.htm) for further discussions on the "Other James".
<BR>

<BR>
NOTE:  The following notes make attempts to differentiate between the two (or more?) James only when known.  This section is merely an attempt to gather all available information on each for the purpose of putting this complex puzzle together.

Database: Full Context of Pittsylvania County, Virginia History
<BR>
Captain James Dillard (3) of Halifax militia, vestryman and justice of the peace, is said (Hill's "History of Henry County, Va.) to be the grandson of James Dillard (1) an English emigrant, and the son of James Dillard, Jr. (2), who married Lucy Wise in 1724, and had issue: Thomas (3), Nicholas (3), James (3) (born 1727), Stephen (3), John (3), and William Terry Dillard.
<BR>

<BR>
In the Quit Rent Rolls of King and Queen County, 1704, are listed: Thomas, Nicholas and Edward Dillard. In 1752 Thomas Dillard, St., James Dillard, Edward Dillard and Thomas Dillard, Jr., patented about $5,000 acres in Halifax along Staunton River and Straightstone Creek.
<BR>

<BR>
Thomas Dillard, Sr.'s will was proven at Pittsylvania Court House, 1774, bequeathed his estate to his sons James and Thomas Dillard, naming Thomas executor. Also mentions Thomas, the son of his son James, and James' other children.
<BR>

<BR>
John Redd said in his "Reminiscences" that John Dillard of Henry County, was "grandson of Captain Dillard of Pittsylvania, Sen." Captain James Dillard, of Indian Wars, was very probably the son of Captain Thomas Dillard, Sr., of Pittsylvania; he is said to have spent his latter years in Amherst Couty, where his will is recorded.
